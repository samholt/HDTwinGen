# Legacy OxCGRT dataset – 25 April 2020

The OxCGRT implemented a new data structure on 28 April 2020. All existing indicators were renamed, many were recoded, and several new indicators were added.

This folder contains the legacy data that was in place before the data migration started on 25 April 2020. The files here have the 13 "S" indicators that the OxCGRT used in March and April. 

- [OxCGRT_20200425 LEGACY](OxCGRT_20200425%20LEGACY.csv) is the full dataset, as at 25 April 2020, without notes.
- [OxCGRT_20200425_withnotes LEGACY](OxCGRT_20200425_withnotes%20LEGACY.csv) is the same dataset but with a notes column for each indicator.
- the [/timeseries](timeseries/) folder contains the same data but in .xlsx and .csv timeseries format.

This old data structure is described in v4 of our [working paper](BSG-WP-2020-032-v4), also archived in this folder.

Please note that this archived dataset from 25 April 2020 is patchy towards the end (mid-April onwards) as we diverted more resources towards the migration to the new data structure, rather than keeping the old database perfectly up to date.
